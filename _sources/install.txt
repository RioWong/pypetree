Installation
============

PypeTree relies on a few packages: the Python bindings for the VTK_ 3D
visualization library, the Numpy_, SciPy_ and NetworkX_ packages for scientific
computations, wxPython_ (UI) and some others.

.. _VTK: http://vtk.org/
.. _Numpy: http://www.numpy.org/
.. _SciPy: http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html
.. _NetworkX: http://networkx.github.io/
.. _wxPython: http://www.wxpython.org/

The first step, if you use ``git``, is to clone the source code repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/cjauvin/pypetree.git

or alternatively, you can download_ the latest snapshot.

.. _download: https://github.com/cjauvin/pypetree/archive/master.zip

Windows
-------

PypeTree is very easy to install on Windows thanks to the `Python(x, y)`_
distribution, which comprises all the necessary packages at once. If you choose
the "custom" install, make sure they are all selected. Also install these two
additional modules from the PyPI repository, with either ``pip`` or
``easy_install``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install webcolors progressbar

.. _Python(x, y): https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/

Linux
-----

On a Ubuntu system it's not much harder:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ apt-get install python-vtk python-numpy python-scipy python-wxgtk2.8 python-networkx

and

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install webcolors progressbar

OSX
---

PypeTree also runs fine on my own Mac laptop, but as I'm pretty sure that the
process has been updated (and smoothened a bit) since I performed it some time
ago, I won't try to state a particular procedure. The easiest way it can be done
is certainly using the `Homebrew`_ package manager, with which all the required
packages can be installed. If someone is interested in trying it, drop me a
line, and I'll update this document with the procedure, and will also provide
help if needed.

.. _Homebrew: http://brew.sh/

To Run
------

Once installed, you can run the program by simply doing

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd pypetree/python
    $ python run.py
